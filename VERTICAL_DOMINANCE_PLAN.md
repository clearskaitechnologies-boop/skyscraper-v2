# VERTICAL DOMINANCE: MASTER STRATEGIC PLAN
## The Operating System for Storm & Insurance Restoration Contractors

> **Last Updated:** 2026-02-16
> **Status:** ACTIVE — This is the living roadmap.
> **Mission:** Become the undisputed platform for roofing & restoration contractors.

---

## 🧭 STRATEGIC POSITIONING

### What We Were
> "CRM for Trades" — generic, horizontal, forgettable.

### What We Are Becoming
> **The AI-powered restoration operating system** connecting claims, crews, materials,
> and accounting in one platform.

### Tagline Candidates
- "From First Inspection to Final Payment — One System."
- "Close More Claims. Move Jobs Faster. Get Paid Sooner."
- "Built for Roofing & Insurance Restoration Contractors."

### Why This Wins
- Vertical SaaS = higher retention, higher ACV, stronger word-of-mouth
- Roofers talk. Storm contractors network. Insurance restoration companies refer each other.
- Every feature reinforces: claims → materials → insurance → cash flow
- Emotional lock-in: "This was made for me."

## 🏗️ THE PLAN — FOUR PHASES

```
Phase 1: REPOSITION     (Weeks 1-2)   ← Messaging, UI, homepage
Phase 2: FLAGSHIP       (Weeks 3-4)   ← Storm Command Center dashboard
Phase 3: BETA LAUNCH    (Weeks 5-6)   ← 10 contractors, feedback loop
Phase 4: MARKET ATTACK  (Weeks 7-10)  ← Content, partnerships, sales
```

## 1.1 — Homepage & Marketing Messaging Overhaul

### TODO-1.1.1: Rewrite Hero Section
**File:** `src/components/marketing/MarketingLanding.tsx`
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL

Current:
```

# 🛑 ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID

1. **Do NOT build more backend abstractions.** The infrastructure layer is complete.
2. **Do NOT optimize performance yet.** Ship features, measure, then optimize.
3. **Do NOT add more trades verticals yet.** Win roofing first.
4. **Do NOT build mobile app yet.** Responsive web first, native later.
5. **Do NOT add social features.** The trades network exists; don't expand it.
6. **Do NOT add more AI tools.** Polish what exists; don't add new ones.
7. **Do NOT refactor the codebase.** It works. Ship value instead.

---

# 🏁 THE BOTTOM LINE

**You have built a 327-page, AI-powered, fully-integrated platform
with weather verification, claims management, material routing,
accounting sync, and migration engines.**

**No competitor in the roofing vertical has this.**

**The only thing missing is:**
1. Telling the market it exists
2. Proving it with real contractors
3. Making the product look as powerful as it actually is

**That's what this plan does.**
