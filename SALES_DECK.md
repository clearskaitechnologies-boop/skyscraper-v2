**We are the Operating System for Storm Restoration.**

### The Old Way (AccuLynx / JobNimbus)

- Manual data entry everywhere
- No AI, no automation, no intelligence
- Project management disguised as restoration software

### The SkaiScraper Way

- Built exclusively for storm restoration
- AI-first: Claims analysis, damage detection, carrier strategy
- Automation: DOL pulls, weather verification, depreciation calculations
- Intelligence: Predictive analytics, bottleneck detection, velocity tracking

## 🔥 OBJECTION HANDLING

### "We're already using AccuLynx"

> "Perfect. How many of your claims are currently stuck in adjuster review with no visibility into why? SkaiScraper doesn't replace AccuLynx — it makes your team 3x faster at moving claims through the pipeline."

### "Your price seems high"

> "Our average customer closes 1 additional claim per month from velocity gains alone. At $50K average claim value, that's $600K/year. We cost $1,680/year. That's a 357x ROI."

### "We don't have time to learn new software"

> "Most teams are fully onboarded in 48 hours. The AI does the heavy lifting — your team just clicks buttons. We'll migrate your first 10 claims for free."

### "What about data migration?"

> "We have direct integrations with AccuLynx, EagleView, GAF, and all major carriers. Most migrations take 2-4 hours, and we handle it for you."
