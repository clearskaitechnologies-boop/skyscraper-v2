Sora prompts for hero images

Instructions

- Replace the placeholders in each .txt prompt with your real brand values before pasting into Sora.
  - {COMPANY_NAME}, {ROC_NUMBER}, {CONTACT_NAME}, {CONTACT_EMAIL}, {CONTACT_PHONE}, {WEBSITE_URL}
  - {LOGO_URL} (transparent PNG), {HEADSHOT_URL}
  - {PRIMARY}, {SECONDARY}, {ACCENT}
- Each prompt is crafted to produce a 1600×900 JPG, photo-real, print-quality.
- Files:
  - 08 hero prompts (one file per category)
  - 03 optional cover prompts

Example usage

1. Open a prompt file, replace placeholders with actual values.
2. Paste into Sora and generate at 1600×900 JPG.
3. Download images and add them to `public/images/heroes/` in this repo (or a path you prefer).

If you want, I can also create a small script to batch-upload the generated images into the repo and commit them—just tell me where Sora saves them locally.
