# Refund & Cancellation — Simple Version

## All sales are final

We don't offer refunds unless we explicitly say so.

## AI results cannot be refunded

AI can make mistakes. Because of this, refunds are **not** given for:

- AI errors
- Bad claim outcomes
- Denials from insurance

Always double-check AI output.

## Subscriptions renew automatically

You're billed until you cancel. Cancel before your renewal date to avoid the next charge.

## Cancelling does NOT refund past payments

Your account stays active until your billing period ends.

## Chargebacks are not allowed

If you file a chargeback, your account may be closed.
