# Contractor Agreement — Simple Version

## You are not our employee

You run your own business. You're responsible for your licenses, insurance, safety, and work quality.

## We are not responsible for your work

SkaiScraper does not guarantee or supervise your jobs.

## AI is just a tool

AI can be wrong. You must check everything yourself.

Do NOT use AI as certified damage assessment or engineering advice.

## You're responsible for what you upload

Make sure all photos, notes, and docs are real, accurate, and legal.

## If anything goes wrong with your work

That's on you — not SkaiScraper.
