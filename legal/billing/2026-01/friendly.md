# Billing Addendum — Simple Version

## Stripe handles all billing

We don't store your full card details.

## Subscriptions renew automatically

You are charged until you cancel. No refunds for past charges.

## AI and usage fees

Some features may have usage-based or extra fees.

## Failed payments

If your card fails, you must update your payment info or your account may be paused.

## Chargebacks

False chargebacks violate our terms and may result in account closure.
