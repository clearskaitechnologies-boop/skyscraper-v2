## The Formula

Vertical SaaS valuation = **ARR × Revenue Multiple**

Revenue multiples for vertical SaaS (2025-2026 market):

| Growth Profile               | Multiple | Examples                     |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------- |
| Slow growth (<20% YoY)       | 5-8x     | Legacy platforms             |
| Moderate growth (20-50% YoY) | 8-15x    | ServiceTitan early           |
| High growth (50-100% YoY)    | 15-25x   | Procore growth phase         |
| Hypergrowth (100%+ YoY)      | 25-40x   | Vertical AI-native platforms |

## SkaiScraper at Key ARR Milestones

### Current: ~$84K ARR

Too early for institutional valuation. This is **founder-mode**. The company is worth whatever you say it's worth in a conversation with an angel.

Soft valuation: **$1-3M** (pre-revenue multiple doesn't apply, this is vision + traction).

### Why SkaiScraper Commands a Premium

1. **AI-native architecture** — not a feature, the core product
2. **95.6% gross margin** — ServiceTitan is ~70%, Procore is ~65%
3. **No per-seat infrastructure cost** — serverless = marginal cost near zero
4. **Vertical monopoly** — no dedicated storm restoration OS exists
5. **28:1 LTV:CAC** — indicates massive untapped demand
6. **Enterprise + SMB dual motion** — two revenue engines

## Exit Scenarios

| Scenario                     | Timeline    | Valuation | Buyer Profile                          |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- | --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Acqui-hire**               | Now         | $5-15M    | ServiceTitan, Procore, AccuLynx parent |
| **Strategic acquisition**    | $5-10M ARR  | $75-200M  | Private equity (Vista, Thoma Bravo)    |
| **Growth-stage acquisition** | $20-50M ARR | $400M-$1B | Large vertical SaaS platform           |
| **IPO track**                | $100M+ ARR  | $1.5-2.5B | Public markets                         |

### Most Likely Path

**Private equity at $10-15M ARR.** Vista Equity and Thoma Bravo are the most active acquirers of vertical SaaS platforms in this range. They'll pay 15-25x ARR for a high-margin, category-defining platform with proven enterprise traction.

At $12.6M ARR × 20x = **$252M exit.**

Founder with 70% equity = **$176M.**

## The Rule of 40

The "Rule of 40" states that a healthy SaaS company's growth rate + profit margin should exceed 40%.

| Metric               | SkaiScraper (projected) |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Revenue growth rate  | 100%+ YoY               |
| Gross margin         | 95.6%                   |
| **Rule of 40 score** | **195+**                |

For context: Best-in-class public SaaS companies score 60-80. You're at 195.

This is what "sitting on a machine" looks like.
