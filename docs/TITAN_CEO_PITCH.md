# The 3-Minute CEO Pitch — Titan Roofing

> **Internal script. Read it once. Internalize the beats. Then throw it away and be human.**

---

## Beat 1 — The Problem (30 seconds)

> "Let me ask you something.
>
> How many claims does your team have open right now?"

_[They answer — probably 200-400]_

> "And how many of those have been sitting in the same stage for more than two weeks?"

_[They won't know the exact number]_

> "That's the problem. Nobody knows. Your revenue is trapped in a pipeline nobody can see.
>
> Every claim sitting idle is $45,000+ waiting to close. Ten stuck claims? That's half a million dollars frozen because your team doesn't have visibility."

---

## Beat 2 — What We Do (45 seconds)

> "SkaiScraper is the operating system for storm restoration.
>
> We do three things:
>
> **One** — AI reads photos and generates adjuster-ready reports in 30 seconds. Not 3 hours. 30 seconds.
>
> **Two** — We pull Date of Loss, weather verification, and carrier performance data automatically. Your team stops chasing paperwork and starts closing.
>
> **Three** — We show you exactly where money is stuck. Which claims are idle, which carriers are slow, which adjusters approve fastest. Real-time. Across your entire operation.
>
> Your team doesn't work harder. They work on the right things."

---

## Beat 3 — The Proof (45 seconds)

> "We stress-tested this platform last week at 500 simultaneous users.
>
> 160,000 requests in four minutes. Zero errors. Sub-250 millisecond response times.
>
> That's not a demo environment. That's production. Your 180 people could all log in Monday morning at 8am and the system wouldn't blink.
>
> We process on Vercel's edge network — same infrastructure that runs Hulu, The Washington Post, and Under Armour. Your data sits in a dedicated Supabase database with row-level tenant isolation. Nobody sees your data. Nobody touches your data.
>
> SOC 2 compliant. HIPAA-ready. SLA-backed."

---

## Beat 4 — The Money (30 seconds)

> "Your competitors are paying AccuLynx $149 per user per month. That's $26,820 a month for a team your size. $321,840 a year. For a CRM.
>
> We're $80 per seat. That's $14,400 a month for the entire platform.
>
> But here's the real number: our average customer closes 1-2 additional claims per month just from velocity gains. At your volume, that's $50,000 to $100,000 a month in revenue you're not capturing right now.
>
> The software doesn't cost you money. It makes you money."

---

## Beat 5 — The Close (30 seconds)

> "Here's what I'd like to do.
>
> Let's put 20 of your best people on it for two weeks. No commitment. Just your hardest claims. If they don't see the difference in the first week, we shake hands and part ways.
>
> But I'll tell you what's going to happen: your team is going to come back and say 'why didn't we have this six months ago?'
>
> Can we start with your top crew?"

## Objection Pocket Cards

### "We already use AccuLynx"

> "Great — so you understand the workflow. The difference is AccuLynx tells you _what_ happened. We tell you _what to do next_. And we do it for half the cost."

### "We need to think about it"

> "Totally fair. While you're thinking, your competitors are closing the claims you're sitting on. The pilot is free. What's the downside?"

### "$80/seat is still a lot for 180 people"

> "It's $14,400/month. Your team processes what — 200 claims a month at $45K average? That's $9M in monthly pipeline. We're 0.16% of your revenue. And we'll increase that revenue by 5-10%."

### "What about data migration?"

> "We have a data import tool that handles AccuLynx, JobNimbus, CompanyCam, and Xactimate exports. Same-day migration. We tested it on 40 records with zero errors. Your 180 users will be live within a week."

### "What if it goes down?"

> "We have an SLA guarantee. 99.5% uptime, contractual. We tested 500 concurrent users with zero errors. Your team is 180. We have 2.7x headroom before we even start thinking about scaling."

_Don't sell software. Sell the moment their team says "holy shit, where has this been?"_
