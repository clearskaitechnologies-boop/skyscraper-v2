### From Here Forward

- Engineering survival → Product strategy
- "Does it work?" → "How do we grow?"
- Building → Scaling
- Prototype → Production

- 6-phase certification audit
- 51 routes verified
- 200+ mock references audited
- Zero critical blockers
- 100% production-ready

The remaining work is **product decisions**, not technical survival.
