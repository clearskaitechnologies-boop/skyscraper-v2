# Builder Module

This folder contains the main components for the SKAI Builder UI overhaul:

- `BuilderShell.tsx`: Main shell, template-aware layout, section composition.
- `SectionCard.tsx`: Renders individual section cards.
- `RightBar.tsx`: Sidebar for template info, add-ons, export logic.
- `index.tsx`: Entry point for builder route.

Next steps:

- Implement add-on registry and cards.
- Wire up export logic and template-aware layouts.
- Integrate with SectionRegistry and AIEngineRegistry.
