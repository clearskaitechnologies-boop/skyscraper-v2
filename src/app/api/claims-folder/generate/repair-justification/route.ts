- Fractures in shingle surface creating water intrusion pathways

## Repair Justification Report
### Claim: ${input.claimId}
### Property: ${input.propertyAddress}

This document provides technical justification for each repair item, citing applicable building codes and manufacturer specifications. All repairs are necessary to restore the property to pre-loss condition while maintaining code compliance.

### Scope Overview

${input.hasEstimate && input.estimateTotal ? `**Estimated Total (RCV):** $${input.estimateTotal.toLocaleString()}` : "*Estimate pending*"}

The scope of repairs addresses storm-related damage to the roofing system. Each line item below includes:
- Quantity and unit of measure
- Reason for repair/replacement
- Applicable building code reference
- Technical justification supporting the necessity

All repairs must be performed by qualified contractors following manufacturer specifications and local building code requirements.
`.trim();

  const codeCompliance = `
### Building Code Compliance Statement

All repairs specified in this scope are required to restore the property to pre-loss condition while maintaining compliance with:

- **International Residential Code (IRC) 2021** - Sections R903-R905 governing roof assemblies
- **Local Building Code Amendments** - As adopted by jurisdiction
- **ASTM Standards** - Applicable material and installation standards
- **FM Global Requirements** - Where applicable for commercial components

The scope accounts for code-required upgrades per IRC R102.7.1, which mandates that repairs, alterations, and additions comply with current code requirements to the extent required for new construction when the work area includes the repair scope.

### Key Code Requirements Applied:

1. **Underlayment** (IRC R905.1.1) - Required beneath all roof coverings
2. **Drip Edge** (IRC R905.2.8.5) - Required at eaves and rakes
3. **Flashing** (IRC R903.2) - Required at intersections and penetrations
4. **Ice Barrier** (IRC R905.1.2) - Required in cold climates where applicable
5. **Ventilation** (IRC R806) - Must meet minimum requirements
`.trim();

  const manufacturerSpecs = `
### Manufacturer Specification Compliance

Repairs will be performed in accordance with manufacturer installation requirements to maintain warranty coverage:

**Shingle Manufacturer Requirements:**
- Minimum 4 nails per shingle (6 in high-wind areas)
- Proper exposure limits per shingle type
- Starter strip at all eaves and rakes
- Hip and ridge shingle installation per spec
- Temperature limitations during installation

**Underlayment Requirements:**
- Minimum 4" head lap, 6" side lap
- Proper fastener pattern per manufacturer
- Cap nails or approved fasteners only

**Accessory Requirements:**
- Metal flashings minimum 26 gauge galvanized
- Sealants compatible with roofing materials
- Proper ventilation balance maintained

*Failure to follow manufacturer specifications may void warranty coverage.*
