## Cause of Loss Narrative
### Claim #${claimNumber}

**Insured:** ${insured_name}  
**Property:** ${propertyAddress}  
**Date of Loss:** ${dateOfLoss}

### Event Summary

The insured property sustained damage on ${dateOfLoss}. A weather verification analysis is pending to correlate documented damage patterns with meteorological events for this date and location.

### Damage Assessment

Field inspection revealed damage consistent with storm activity. ${photoCount > 0 ? `${photoCount} photographs documenting the damage have been captured and analyzed.` : "Photographic documentation is recommended."}

### Next Steps

- Obtain certified weather data for the date of loss
- Complete comprehensive photo documentation
- Correlate damage patterns with storm trajectory

*This narrative will be updated upon receipt of verified weather data.*

## Cause of Loss Narrative
### Claim #${claimNumber}

**Insured:** ${insured_name}  
**Property:** ${propertyAddress}  
**Date of Loss:** ${dateOfLoss}

### Verified Weather Event

According to ${weather.source || "weather records"}, the subject property experienced ${weather.conditions || "severe weather conditions"} on ${weather.eventDate}.

**Recorded Conditions:**
- Wind Activity: ${weather.windSpeed || "Elevated wind speeds"}
- Hail Activity: ${weather.hailSize || "Hail activity confirmed"}
- Event Classification: Severe Storm

### Damage Correlation

The damage documented at the subject property is consistent with the verified weather event. Inspection findings demonstrate:

1. **Impact Damage Pattern** - Random pattern distribution across roof surfaces indicates hail impact rather than wear-related deterioration
2. **Directional Evidence** - Damage concentration on windward exposures aligns with recorded storm trajectory
3. **Freshness Indicators** - Bright aluminum visible on metal components and fresh granule displacement indicate recent damage rather than pre-existing conditions

### Supporting Documentation

${
  photoCount > 0
    ? `- **${photoCount} photographs** documenting damage patterns and conditions
- AI-assisted photo analysis identifying damage types and severity
- Weather certification from verified meteorological sources`
    : "- Photographic documentation pending"
}

### Professional Opinion

Based on the correlation of verified weather data with documented damage patterns, it is the professional opinion that the damage to this property was caused by the storm event of ${dateOfLoss}. The damage patterns, freshness indicators, and distribution are consistent with hail and wind impact from the documented severe weather event.

### Recommendations

The scope of repairs necessary to restore this property to pre-loss condition includes replacement/repair of all storm-damaged components identified in the attached estimate. All work should be performed in accordance with applicable building codes and manufacturer specifications.
