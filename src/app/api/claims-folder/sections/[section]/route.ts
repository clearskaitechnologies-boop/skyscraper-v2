    narrative: `Based on comprehensive inspection findings and industry standards, full roof replacement is required for the subject property at 123 Main Street, Phoenix, AZ 85001.

The January 15, 2026 hailstorm caused significant damage across all roof elevations, with impact patterns consistent with 1.25" diameter hail verified by NOAA storm reports. Brittle test results indicate shingle failure at 8 of 10 test locations, demonstrating the roofing material has exceeded its functional lifespan due to storm damage.

Key factors supporting full replacement include:

1. GRANULE LOSS: Laboratory analysis confirms granule loss exceeding 25% across representative samples, compromising the shingle's ability to provide adequate weather protection.

2. PATTERN DAMAGE: Directional hail damage is present on all four elevations, indicating system-wide impact rather than isolated damage areas.

3. SPOT REPAIR INFEASIBILITY: Due to the extent of damage and material discontinuation, spot repairs would result in a patchwork appearance and compromise overall roof integrity.

4. CODE COMPLIANCE: Current IRC 2021 requirements mandate enhanced underlayment and fastening schedules that cannot be achieved through partial repairs.

5. MANUFACTURER WARRANTY: GAF warranty requirements specify full system replacement when damage exceeds threshold levels documented in this report.

Professional recommendation: Authorize full roof system replacement to restore property to pre-loss condition and ensure compliance with current building codes.`,
