PROPERTY INFORMATION:
Address: ${propertyAddress}

Loss Type: ${claimType}
Status: ${claim.status}

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
Comprehensive inspection conducted on ${new Date().toLocaleDateString()}. Damage consistent with recent storm event. All damage directly related to covered peril.

FINDINGS:
1. Primary roof damage from high winds and hail impact
2. Secondary water intrusion damage to interior
3. Gutters and fascia compromised
4. No pre-existing conditions that would limit coverage

DOCUMENTATION:
- 47 photos documenting all damage
- Weather data confirming storm on date of loss
- Moisture readings confirming active leak
- Contractor estimates for validation

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. APPROVE: Full roof replacement justified by extent of damage
2. APPROVE: Interior repairs necessary to restore property
3. APPROVE: Exterior trim and gutter work required
4. Estimated Total: $14,477 (RCV)
5. Depreciation holdback: $5,640 (recoverable)

CONCLUSION:
All damage is directly attributable to covered storm event. Recommend approval of claim as documented. Property owner has acted in good faith to mitigate further damage.

Next Steps:
- Issue initial payment (ACV)
- Authorize repairs to proceed
- Schedule final inspection for depreciation recovery
