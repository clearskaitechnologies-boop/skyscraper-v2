        <StorySection title="How It Started">
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
            SkaiScraper was born in the middle of a storm—literally and spiritually. After surviving
            childhood trauma, homelessness, incarceration, and rebuilding life from the ground up,
            Damien saw firsthand the brokenness of the restoration and insurance process.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
            Homeowners were left confused. Contractors were drowning in paperwork. Insurance
            companies were months behind.
            <span className="font-semibold text-white"> Something had to change.</span>
          </p>

        <StorySection title="The Moment Everything Shifted">
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
            One day, while standing on a damaged roof in northern Arizona with a homeowner crying
            beside him, Damien made the decision:
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4 text-center text-2xl font-semibold italic text-white">
            "If nobody is going to fix this system… I will."
          </p>

          <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
            That moment became the foundation of SkaiScraper — a complete, AI-powered restoration
            operating system to rebuild trust, speed, transparency, and hope into an industry that
            desperately needs it.

        <StorySection title="The Founder's Mission">
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">Damien's mission is simple:</p>
