// --- 1. COMPATIBILITY TYPE DEFINITION ---

/**
 * The `ClaimCompat` type is a compatibility layer that translates the current
 * Prisma schema into the shape expected by the legacy Claims UI components.
 *
 * It manually maps fields from the `claims`, `properties`, and `contacts`
 * models to the old field names that the UI still uses (e.g., `insured_name`).
 * This avoids having to rewrite the entire UI at once.
 *
 * - `insured_name` is derived from the associated property's contact.
 * - `homeownerEmail` and `homeownerPhone` also come from the property's contact.
 * - `policyNumber` and `carrier` come from the property record.
 * - `coverPhotoUrl` is hardcoded to null as the old `claim_uploads` table is gone.
 *
 * This type should be used by all Claims pages and components.
 */

// --- 2. PRISMA SELECTORS ---

 * `claimSelectLite` includes the minimal set of relations needed for the
 * main claims list view. It fetches the `properties` and its related `contacts`
 * to build the `ClaimCompat` type.

/**
 * `claimSelectForWorkspace` is a more comprehensive selector for the main
 * claim workspace view, including additional relations.
 *
 * NOTE: This currently mirrors `claimSelectLite` but can be expanded as
 * more relations are safely added back.

 * fetched with the required relations and transforms it into the `ClaimCompat`
 * shape that the UI expects.
 *
 * @param claim - The claim object from Prisma.
 * @returns A `ClaimCompat` object.
