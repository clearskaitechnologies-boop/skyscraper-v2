// CANONICAL PRISMA SINGLETON — SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
//
// ⚠️  CRITICAL: The singleton MUST be cached on `globalThis` in ALL
//    environments, including production.  Vercel Serverless reuses the
//    same Node process across many warm invocations.  Without the cache,
//    every invocation creates a **new** PrismaClient, opens fresh DB
//    connections, and never releases them → "Too many database connections
//    opened: FATAL: remaining connection slots reserved for superuser".
//
//    Fix applied 2025-06: Always assign to globalThis.__prisma.

import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

declare global {
  // eslint-disable-next-line no-var
  var __prisma: PrismaClient | undefined;

/**
 * Connection pool settings for 10,000-user enterprise scale:
 *
 * Prisma connection pool limits (per instance):
 *   - connection_limit ➜ set via DATABASE_URL query param
 *   - pool_timeout     ➜ set via DATABASE_URL query param
 *
 * Recommended DATABASE_URL for Supabase PgBouncer (port 6543):
 *   ?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=5&pool_timeout=20
 *
 * Recommended DIRECT_DATABASE_URL (port 5432, no PgBouncer):
 *   Used for migrations only (prisma migrate / db push)
 *
 * At scale with Vercel Serverless (~50 concurrent functions):
 *   Each function has its own pool of up to `connection_limit` connections.
 *   Total DB connections = concurrent_functions × connection_limit.
 *   PgBouncer's transaction-mode pooling prevents exhaustion.
 *
 * Safety limits are enforced in the query engine via datasource URL params.
 * Additional in-app safeguards are handled by this module.
