## 📋 DEMO SCRIPT (12 minutes)

### INTRODUCTION (1 minute)

> "Thanks for joining! I'm going to show you why restoration teams are switching from AccuLynx to SkaiScraper.
>
> This isn't about project management — it's about performance intelligence. By the end of this demo, you'll see exactly where your claims are getting stuck and how to fix it."

**Ask qualifying question:**

> "Quick question before we dive in — how many claims are you currently working, and what's your biggest pain point right now?"

_[Listen for: cycle time, stuck claims, carrier delays, manual processes]_

---

### ACT 1: THE PROBLEM (2 minutes)

**Show AccuLynx/JobNimbus Dashboard (screenshot)**

> "This is what most teams see every day. A list of tasks. Some green checkmarks, some red warnings. But here's the problem..."

**Point to issues:**

- "No visibility into WHY claims are stuck"
- "No carrier performance data"
- "No predictive intelligence"
- "Just tasks and due dates"

**Transition:**

> "Now let me show you what a Storm Restoration Operating System looks like..."

---

### ACT 2: STORM COMMAND CENTER (3 minutes)

**Open SkaiScraper Dashboard**

#### 2.1 Velocity Dashboard (45 seconds)

> "This is our Storm Command Center. Every claim, color-coded by velocity."

**Show:**

- Green claims (moving fast, < 10 days in stage)
- Yellow claims (normal pace, 10-20 days)
- Red claims (stuck, 20+ days)

> "See these 3 red claims? They're all stuck in the same stage with the same carrier. That's a pattern. AI caught it."

#### 2.2 Bottleneck Detection (60 seconds)

**Click on stuck claim #R-2024-0142**

> "Let's drill into this one. Filed 18 days ago, stuck in supplement review with State Farm."

**Show AI analysis panel:**

- **Carrier Benchmark:** "State Farm averages 12 days on supplements"
- **This Claim:** "18 days — 50% slower than average"
- **AI Recommendation:** "Escalate to supervisor. Cite policy timeline Section 7.2"

> "The AI isn't just tracking — it's telling us exactly what to do."

#### 2.3 Carrier Performance Analytics (60 seconds)

**Click "Analytics" tab**

> "Here's where it gets powerful. Carrier performance benchmarking."

**Show chart:**

- State Farm: Avg 12 days on supplements
- Allstate: Avg 18 days
- Farmers: Avg 9 days

> "Now you know which carriers move fast and which ones to push harder on. This is data you can't get anywhere else."

---

### ACT 3: AI IN ACTION (4 minutes)

**Now let's process a claim live.**

#### 3.1 Photo Upload + AI Analysis (90 seconds)

**Click "New Claim" → Upload Photos**

> "I'm uploading 8 photos from a storm damage inspection..."

**While uploading:**

> "Watch what happens. No manual data entry. The AI does everything."

**AI processes in real-time:**

- Detects 47 damage points
- Identifies roof material (architectural shingles)
- Calculates affected area (1,847 sq ft)
- Estimates repair cost ($23,400)

> "47 damage points identified in 8 seconds. That would've taken you 30 minutes manually."

#### 3.2 Weather Verification (60 seconds)

**Click "Weather Verification" button**

> "Now watch this — automated Date of Loss verification."

**System auto-pulls:**

- NOAA weather data for property location
- Hail reports, wind speeds, precipitation
- Generates certified report with timestamps

> "Certified weather report in 30 seconds. Most contractors spend 2-3 hours on this."

#### 3.3 AI Report Generation (90 seconds)

**Click "Generate AI Report"**

> "Last step — full inspection report."

**AI generates:**

- Complete damage assessment
- Room-by-room breakdown
- Photo documentation with annotations
- Scope of work with line items
- Estimated timeline

**Download PDF and show**

> "Full professional report. 45 seconds. Ready to send to the adjuster."

### ACT 4: THE STRATEGY ENGINE (2 minutes)

**Click "Carrier Strategy" tab**

> "Now here's where SkaiScraper becomes your strategic weapon."

**Show AI Strategy Panel:**

**Carrier Analysis:**

- "State Farm — this adjuster approves supplements 78% of the time"
- "Recommended approach: Submit full scope + detailed photos upfront"
- "Typical response time: 8-12 days"

**Supplement Prediction:**

- "AI predicts 67% chance of supplement approval based on damage type + carrier history"
- "Recommended supplement items: underlayment, valley metal, drip edge"

**Depreciation Strategy:**

- "Recoverable depreciation: $4,200"
- "Recommended timeline for recovery: Post-completion invoice + photos"
- "Success rate with this carrier: 91%"

> "This is why we call it an Operating System. It's not just tracking your work — it's making you smarter."

### CLOSE & TRIAL OFFER (1 minute)

**Recap:**

> "So in 12 minutes, you saw:
>
> - Bottleneck detection that saves you hours
> - AI claim processing in seconds instead of hours
> - Carrier intelligence that increases your win rate
> - Automated reporting that looks more professional than anything you've done manually"

**Trial Offer:**

> "Here's what I'd recommend. Let's run your next 10 claims through SkaiScraper. Free trial, no credit card required. If you don't see a 20% reduction in cycle time within 30 days, we'll give you a full refund."

**Next Steps:**

> "I can get you set up today. Takes about 20 minutes to import your existing claims from AccuLynx. When would you like to start — this week or next?"

---

## 🎯 OBJECTION HANDLING DURING DEMO

### "How does it integrate with AccuLynx?"

> "We have direct API integration. We pull your claims, contacts, and documents automatically. Most migrations take 2-4 hours, and we handle it for you. You can run both systems in parallel during the trial."

### "What about our existing photos/documents?"

> "All migrated automatically. We support all major formats — JPG, PNG, PDF, DOC. Your entire claim history comes over with full integrity."

### "Is there training required?"

> "Most teams are fully onboarded in 48 hours. The AI does the heavy lifting — your team just uploads photos and clicks buttons. We provide live training sessions and a dedicated onboarding specialist."

### "What if we have unique workflows?"

> "We've built custom workflows for 50+ restoration companies. During onboarding, we map your exact process into the system. It adapts to you, not the other way around."

### "How accurate is the AI?"

> "The damage detection AI has a 94% accuracy rate, trained on 500,000+ storm damage photos. Weather verification pulls from NOAA certified data. Cost estimates are within 8% of final adjuster settlement 89% of the time."

## 🚀 DEMO BEST PRACTICES

### DO's

✅ Let them talk first (understand pain points)  
✅ Use THEIR data (import a real claim if possible)  
✅ Show bottlenecks immediately (they feel the pain)  
✅ Let AI wow them (don't over-explain, just show)  
✅ Focus on velocity/revenue (not features)  
✅ Offer immediate trial (strike while hot)

### DON'Ts

❌ Feature dump (they don't care about buttons)  
❌ Technical jargon (keep it business-focused)  
❌ Generic demo (customize to their pain)  
❌ Rush through AI processing (let it wow them)  
❌ Talk price before value (ROI first, cost second)  
❌ End without clear next step (always close with trial)
