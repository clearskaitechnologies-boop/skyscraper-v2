## SkaiScraper Launches Restoration Operating System to End $600B Industry Chaos

**Phoenix, AZ — December 2, 2025** — SkaiScraper, the first true operating system for storm damage restoration, today announced its official launch with $750K in seed funding. Founded by former restoration contractor Damien Ray Willingham, the platform connects homeowners, contractors, and insurance companies on a single real-time platform—ending decades of industry dysfunction.

### **The Problem: A $600 Billion Industry Running on Spreadsheets**

Every year, 5 million Americans file storm damage claims. The process is chaotic: homeowners don't know what's happening to their property, contractors struggle with paper-based workflows, and insurance companies process claims with 1990s technology. The result? Delays, disputes, and distrust across a $600 billion market.

"I watched families lose everything because no one could see what was happening," said Willingham, SkaiScraper Founder & CEO. "Homeowners calling contractors 20 times a day. Contractors drowning in paperwork. Insurance adjusters flying blind. I built SkaiScraper because I needed it to survive in this industry—and now every contractor in America needs it too."

### **The Solution: Real-Time Transparency for Everyone**

SkaiScraper is the industry's first three-sided platform:

- **Homeowners** see every photo, update, and dollar in real-time through an intuitive mobile app
- **Contractors** generate AI-powered estimates in 60 seconds, manage entire pipelines, and get paid instantly via Stripe Connect
- **Insurance companies** receive verified documentation, detect fraud with AI, and process claims at digital speed

The platform is built on enterprise-grade infrastructure (Next.js 14, PostgreSQL, OpenAI GPT-4) with consumer-level design, making it the first restoration tool that everyone actually wants to use.

### **Early Traction: Validation Before Launch**

Despite being pre-launch with zero paid marketing, SkaiScraper has:

- ✅ **15+ contractors validated** the platform in real-world storm damage scenarios
- ✅ **$2.4M+ in pipeline value** from early adopter commitments
- ✅ **100% contractor retention** after onboarding demos

"This isn't a nice-to-have tool—it's the difference between surviving and failing in this business," said one early beta contractor. "I can't go back to spreadsheets after seeing SkaiScraper."

### **Founder Story: From Prison to Platform**

Damien Ray Willingham's path to founding SkaiScraper is unconventional. After serving 9 years incarcerated, he was released into Arizona's brutal storm season and became a restoration contractor. Witnessing the industry's chaos firsthand—and surviving it—gave him unique insight into what was broken and how to fix it.

"Most founders build from theory. I built from necessity," Willingham said. "I know what it feels like to be the contractor who can't answer a homeowner's call because I'm on a roof. I know what it's like to lose a job because I couldn't get an estimate done fast enough. SkaiScraper is survival technology."

### **Market Opportunity: Category Creation in a $600B Industry**

The restoration industry is massive but underserved:

- 200,000+ contractors operating in the US
- 5 million insurance claims filed annually
- 12% year-over-year growth driven by climate change
- Zero dominant software platform (yet)

SkaiScraper isn't competing with existing tools—it's creating a new category: **The Restoration Operating System**. Just as Shopify became the OS for e-commerce and Salesforce became the OS for sales, SkaiScraper is becoming the OS for storm damage restoration.

### **What's Next: Phoenix Launch and National Expansion**

SkaiScraper's $750K seed round will fund:

- **Q1 2025:** Phoenix metro launch with 100 contractors
- **Q2 2025:** Mobile apps (iOS/Android) and regional expansion (Southwest US)
- **Q3 2025:** Insurance company integrations and enterprise pilot programs
- **Q4 2025:** Series A fundraise and national rollout
