## 💰 PRICING COMPARISON

### The Competitor Trap

| Competitor    | Pricing Model   | Hidden Costs                           |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **AccuLynx**  | $149/user/month | 10 users = $1,490/month = $17,880/year |
| **JobNimbus** | $125/user/month | 10 users = $1,250/month = $15,000/year |
| **Roofle**    | $99/user/month  | 10 users = $990/month = $11,880/year   |

**The Problem:** Per-seat pricing punishes you for growing your team.

## 🎯 OBJECTION HANDLING

### "Your price seems high compared to [free CRM]"

> "You're right — if you want a digital Rolodex, there are cheaper options. But we're not a CRM. We're a performance intelligence platform.
>
> Here's the question: Would you rather save $100/month on software, or make an extra $50,000/month by closing claims faster?"

**Follow-up:**

> "Our average customer closes 1-2 additional claims per month just from velocity gains. At $50K average claim value, that's $600K-$1.2M in additional annual revenue. We cost $1,680/year. That's a 357x ROI on the low end."

---

### "We're already paying for AccuLynx"

> "Perfect. How many users do you have?"

_[They say 10 users]_

> "So you're paying $17,880/year for task management. We're $1,680/year for AI-powered performance intelligence. You'd save $16,200/year AND get:
>
> - AI claim processing
> - Automated DOL verification
> - Carrier analytics
> - Velocity tracking
>
> Most teams run both in parallel for 30 days, see the difference, then cancel AccuLynx."

---

### "What if we only have 5 users?"

> "Then you're saving even more. AccuLynx at 5 users = $8,940/year. We're $1,680/year with unlimited seats.
>
> Here's the kicker: When you hire your 6th, 7th, 8th person, AccuLynx charges you $1,788/year per person. We charge you $0. Scale without penalty."

---

### "Can we just pay per seat like AccuLynx?"

> "We could do that, but it would cost you more. Here's why we don't:
>
> Per-seat pricing punishes growth. We want you to hire aggressively, scale fast, and dominate your market. Unlimited users means no hesitation to onboard sales reps, admins, or field teams.
>
> Plus, you get predictable costs. No surprise bills when you add people."

---

### "What about enterprise pricing?"

> "For teams over 100 claims/month, we have custom pricing with:
>
> - Dedicated success manager
> - Custom integrations (Xactimate, EagleView, etc.)
> - White-label options
> - API access for custom workflows
>
> Let's talk about your volume and I'll build a custom package."

## 🔥 CLOSING NARRATIVE

### The Conversation

**Prospect:** "I need to think about it."

**You:** "Totally fair. What's your current monthly cost for [AccuLynx/JobNimbus]?"

**Prospect:** "$1,490/month for 10 users."

**You:** "And how many claims are currently stuck in supplement review with no visibility?"

**Prospect:** "Probably 5-6."

**You:** "Okay. So you're paying $17,880/year for software that can't tell you WHY those 6 claims are stuck or HOW to fix them.

> We're $1,680/year — that's $16,200 in savings — AND we'll tell you exactly which claims are stuck, which carrier is delaying them, and what action to take.
>
> Here's what I'd recommend: Let's run your next 10 claims through SkaiScraper. Free trial. If you don't see a 20% cycle time reduction in 30 days, full refund. Sound fair?"

**Prospect:** "Yeah, let's try it."

**You:** "Perfect. I can get you set up today. Takes 20 minutes to import your claims. When's the best time for a quick onboarding call — this afternoon or tomorrow morning?"
