## 🎯 EXAMPLE: NORTHERN AZ ROOFING

### Company Profile

- **Name:** Northern AZ Roofing
- **Location:** Flagstaff, AZ
- **Size:** 18 employees
- **Annual Revenue:** $8.5M
- **Specialization:** Storm restoration (hail/wind damage)
- **Years in Business:** 12 years
- **Claims Volume:** 40-50 claims/month

---

### THE CHALLENGE

**Business Pain Points:**

1. **No visibility into stuck claims** — 12% of claims were stuck in supplement review with no way to identify why or how to fix it
2. **Manual DOL verification** — 2-3 hours per claim spent pulling weather data, creating reports, certifying dates
3. **Slow claim cycles** — 47-day average cycle time was causing cash flow issues and losing deals to faster competitors
4. **Carrier guesswork** — No data on which carriers approve supplements faster, leading to inconsistent strategies

**Quote from Customer:**

> "We were flying blind. We'd have 5-6 claims sitting in 'adjuster review' for weeks with no idea why. Our PM would call, get vague answers, and we'd just wait. Meanwhile, competitors were closing deals faster."  
> — Jake Morrison, Owner

**Quantified Impact (Before):**

- ❌ **Average claim cycle:** 47 days
- ❌ **Supplement limbo rate:** 12% of active claims
- ❌ **DOL verification time:** 2-3 hours per claim (manual NOAA pulls, report writing)
- ❌ **Lost deals:** 2-3 claims/month to competitors who quoted faster
- ❌ **Labor waste:** 120 hours/month on manual tasks

---

### THE SOLUTION

**What They Implemented:**

- ✅ **Storm Command Center** — Real-time velocity dashboard with bottleneck detection
- ✅ **AI Claim Processing** — Automated damage analysis and report generation
- ✅ **Automated DOL Verification** — One-click weather certification
- ✅ **Carrier Performance Analytics** — Benchmarking supplement approval times by carrier

**Implementation Timeline:**

- **Week 1:** Imported 47 active claims from AccuLynx, trained 3 project managers on AI tools
- **Week 2:** Ran SkaiScraper in parallel with AccuLynx, validated data accuracy
- **Week 3:** Switched 100% to SkaiScraper, deactivated AccuLynx
- **30 Days:** First measurable results — identified that State Farm supplements were averaging 8 days faster than Allstate

**Quote from Customer:**

> "The onboarding was shockingly easy. We were processing claims in SkaiScraper on Day 1. The AI blew our minds — 47 damage points detected in 8 seconds. That would've taken us 30 minutes manually."  
> — Sarah Chen, Operations Manager

---

### THE RESULTS

**Quantified Impact (After 60 days):**

- ✅ **Average claim cycle:** 47 days → 31 days (-34%)
- ✅ **Supplement limbo rate:** 12% → 3% (-75%)
- ✅ **DOL verification time:** 2 hours → 30 seconds (-99%)
- ✅ **Lost deals:** 0 (up from 2-3/month)
- ✅ **Labor saved:** 100 hours/month = $7,500/month

**Revenue Impact:**

- 💰 **$200K additional revenue in Q1** from closing 4 additional claims/month
- 💰 **$22,500 in labor cost savings** over 3 months
- 💰 **$16,200/year saved** by switching from AccuLynx ($17,880/year) to SkaiScraper ($1,680/year)

**Competitive Advantage:**

- 🚀 **Fastest quote-to-contract in market** — AI reports in < 1 minute
- 🚀 **Data-driven carrier strategies** — Know which supplements to push vs. accept
- 🚀 **Zero DOL delays** — Automated certification eliminates adjuster pushback

**Quote from Customer:**

> "We closed $200K in additional revenue in Q1 just from moving claims faster. SkaiScraper paid for itself in the first 2 weeks. This isn't software — it's a competitive weapon."  
> — Jake Morrison, Owner

---

### KEY INSIGHTS

**What Made This Work:**

1. **Full team buy-in** — Owner championed the change, PMs embraced AI tools immediately
2. **Data-driven culture shift** — Started using carrier analytics to inform every supplement strategy
3. **Parallel running** — Kept AccuLynx active for 2 weeks as safety net, built confidence before full switch

**Lessons for Other Teams:**

- Don't wait for "perfect timing" — onboarding takes 48 hours, start now
- Use the velocity dashboard daily — bottleneck detection is the killer feature
- Let AI handle the grunt work (reports, DOL, damage detection) so PMs focus on strategy

---

### CUSTOMER TESTIMONIAL

> "Before SkaiScraper, we were guessing. Now we know. We know exactly which claims are stuck, why they're stuck, and what to do about it. We know which carriers move fast and which ones to push harder on. We know our cycle time is 31 days vs. our competitors' 45+ days. This intelligence is the difference between surviving and dominating in our market. SkaiScraper isn't project management — it's performance intelligence. Game changer."
